<p style="font-family:chiller;">Hi there!!!!!<em>
WELCOME<em><br>I am gonna expound my feelings to you.Sooooo!!Once there,an essence found the right<br>
alternate to itself and it adored a soul.which is you.<br>
I find it had to explain how I AM DEEPLY INTO YOU!You had my heart a long long time ago and I've been trying to make desirable traits( which is right)
<br>Is the discription of love.Though others say that 'out of sight out of mind',that thas not apply to me.<br>
NO day goes without your face flashing in my mind.I SOMETIMES LAY ON BED AT MIDNIGHT THINKING ABOUT YOU.<br>
That mostly makes me happy(besides that miss)This is the best i can do for you now./Hope your consider this lovely.I LOVE YOU<br>
